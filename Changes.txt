Changes to Rdbhdb module

0.9.8

Removed locking, as locking was seriously interfering with
fast parallel action.

All connection attributes are now one in tuple, and reading
and writing that tuple are both atomic operations, so locking
is superfluous.  It was always a bit paranoid, but now it is
pointless, and gone.

Added tests to verify concurrent operation. Tests with asyncio
for the py3aio suite, and with threading for the others.

asyncio code is now 'compiled' from strings, with compile errors
trapped, so does not generate syntax-error noise installing on 2.x.

named parameter strings in queries can be either '%(name)s' or
'%(name)'.  The latter form matches the jQuery library.


0.9.7

Fixed serious problem in 0.9.6, in that Asyncio code,
using 'yield from', broke module for pre py3.3 installs.
Now imports Asyncio code from own modules, so compile
failures are isolated, and don't block functionality in earlier
versions.


0.9.6

Added asyncio-style coroutine methods
Rdbhdb can now be used in any asyncio powered application.
added asyncio tests


0.9.5

One module serves both py2 and py3.  There are two unittest
suites and both pass, with same module.  
Added request compression, and changed dependencies to use 
urllib3 instead of urllib2.
Removed python 2.4 support. No more 'any' function.


0.9.4

Consolidation release, to package py2 and py3 together.


0.9.2

Provides types with request input parameters.
Converts received date fields into Dates, Times, Datetimes, or Decimals, as relevant
Times and Datetimes reported to microsecond resolution.  


0.9.1

Fixed Python 2.4 incompatibility (no 'any' function)
Made https = True the default, for encrypted data transfer


0.9

Added data compression for data sent by server
Added .execute_deferred method
Added .nextset method to handle multiple queries and multiple result sets per
  request.
Added .https attribute to force use of TLS/SSL
Now handles binary data from buffer vars without text-encoding.
